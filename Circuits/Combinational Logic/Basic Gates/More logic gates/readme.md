# Problem Statement

Ok, let's try building several logic gates at the same time. Build a combinational circuit with two inputs, a and b.

There are 7 outputs, each with a logic gate driving it:

- out_and: a and b
- out_or: a or b
- out_xor: a xor b
- out_nand: a nand b
- out_nor: a nor b
- out_xnor: a xnor b
- out_anotb: a and-not b
