# Problem Statement
We're going to start with a small bit of HDL to get familiar with the interface used by HDLBits. Here's the description of the circuit you need to build for this exercise:

Build a circuit with no inputs and one output. That output **should always drive 1** (or logic high).


**Expected solution length**: Around 1 line.
